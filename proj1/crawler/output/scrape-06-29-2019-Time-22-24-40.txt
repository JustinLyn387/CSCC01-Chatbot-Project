We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates.

Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

From the Northwest Resistance of 1885 and for over 60 years, the Canadian Government denied many Indigenous peoples of the prairies the basic freedom to leave their reserves, all the while knowing there was no basis in law for the policy. This investigative documentary features Cree, Saulteaux, Dene, Ojibwe and Blackfoot Elders and their stories of living under and resisting the system, revealing a little-known picture of life under segregation.

Truth, then reconciliation
This year marks Canada’s sesquicentennial, but the history of people on this land goes back far beyond 150 years. In Toronto and Scarborough, the estimate is 10,000 to 13,000 years. The first people recorded in the area in written history were the Huron-Wendat, a confederacy of four nations.
The Solar Walk - Pictures and Video Highlights
A new installation on the UTSC campus commemorates the 150th anniversary of Canada's confederation with a scale model of the solar system. The placement of the markers reflects the exact locations of the celestial objects on July 1, 1867.
Scale model solar system at U of T Scarborough could soon be one of world’s largest
When complete, a new campus-wide scale model solar system at U of T Scarborough may end up being one of the largest of its kind in the world.
Explore the galaxy with U of T Scarborough’s Solar Walk event this long weekend
The Solar Walk is the campus’ new model solar system installation, a permanent feature created through the U of T Scarborough Canada 150 Fund and proposed by Assistant Professor Hanno Rein.
Tour de Scarborough ride highlights suburb cycling
“This is our own way of celebrating Canada 150,” said Scarborough Cycles project coordinator Marvin Macaraig, who helped organize the event. “It’s definitely going to be fun. There’s a lot to see in Scarborough and we want to show people that cycling isn’t just for downtown.”
Sold-out Tour de Scarborough cycling event lives on in published interactive historical guide
The 35-kilometre ride visited seven key historical points around Scarborough. Participants were guided by a website with an interactive map, pictures and descriptions of the stops, and a nine-part audio tour. Watch the video on Facebook.
150 Neighbours helps share the Scarborough story
150 Neighbours is a recognition program that includes a photo documentary series led by the University of Toronto Scarborough to mark the momentous occasion of Canada’s sesquicentennial. Launching July 1, the social media-driven and crowd-sourced campaign will, over 150 days, feature 150 members of the community who are good neighbours, community and nation builders, past and present. 
"Unsettling" Canada 150 at the Doris McCarthy Gallery
A new exhibition on campus has an alternate view of Canada’s sesquicentennial — that of those left out of the country’s flawed utopia. Unsettling, an exhibition addressing the tension between Scarborough’s Indigenous past and its present urban sprawl, is at the Doris McCarthy Gallery from June 22 to July 22 and then again from Sept. 5 to Oct. 21.

Who are we?
	By Bruce Kidd
As an unabashed Canadian nationalist, I’ve been looking forward to Canada’s 150. It’s an opportunity to refresh and strengthen explicitly pan-Canadian institutions and forms of cultural expression in a way that stimulates new ideas and energy for the decades and challenges ahead. Read more.
Canada 150: U of T prepares to mark a big birthday

“The University of Toronto grew up with Canada and our rich history and the country’s history are inseparable,” said Ainslie. “The sesquicentennial gives us a chance to critically examine the country’s past, present and future and the university welcomes the opportunity to be a leading participant in these discussions.” Read more.
True North: Reconciliation
	By Bruce Kidd
The long history of European exploration, trade and settlement in North America has not been beneficial to the Indigenous peoples. The creation and expansion of the Canadian state has meant the paternalistic control of their lives and their lands, and a concerted effort to inhibit if not eliminate their economies, languages and cultural practices. One of the most sorry chapters in this story was the forced removal of their children from families and communities, boarding them in distant residential schools, and trying to strip them of their languages and culture. This is not ancient history. In many cases, as we have shockingly heard from survivors, some residential schools operated as recently as 25 years ago. Read more
Truth and Reconciliation on Campus
	By Rachel Halpern
The injustices Indigenous people have faced throughout history have become a big focus for the Canadian government. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Canada recently published Calls to Action outlining the ways the country can continue the reconciliation process and improve the future for all Indigenous people.

The Department of Arts, Culture and Media is committed to theoretical and practical explorations of images, objects, performance, sound and text. We examine the generation, dissemination, and reception of art and ideas from diverse cultural contexts and historical periods, with special emphasis on the modern and contemporary world. Our research and teaching adopts an interdisciplinary approach to cultural forms, extending from their political life to their emotional impact. As scholars, teachers, artists, arts managers, curators and social actors, we anchor our individual pursuits in shared inquiry using a wide range of critical and creative modes. From the research practices of our collective faculty members, four themes emerge:

Theme 1: Contemporary culture in flux
	• Transnational production and circulation of cultural artifacts and enactments
	• Local and indigenous cultural production in the context of globalization
	We analyze how contemporary culture is rooted in place while also enacted through its circulation and hybridity in a highly globalized world. Our research encompasses multiple regions and diasporas, including East Asia, South-East Asia, Africa, Western and Eastern Europe, Canada and the United States. We examine how practices once defined by local and national conditions are now shaped by forces extending across cultures. Our work considers global collisions and convergences in diverse areas such as alternative modernisms and globalizations in art, the legacies of Cold War geopolitics, and local media cultures.

Theme 2: Cultural history, theory and ethics
	• Cultural policy and analysis for social justice
	• Historical research and its reformulations
	We conceptualize and re-examine cultural forms in relation to wider modes of thought. Our research theorizes the role of art, culture and technology in identity formation, in social movements for diversity and equity and in shaping cultural policy and organizations for rapidly shifting societies. We study cultures in historical context and through their iterations, resonances and remediations down through the centuries.

Theme 3: (Re)making art and culture
	• The power of imagination and creation
	• Empowerment through collaboration and digital technologies
	We are critical producers of art and culture. Our research embraces the social and political force of imagination, poetics, humour, and the everyday. Our work defines emerging technological paradigms and examines contemporary models of access, sharing, activism, and public engagement. We make new culture and critical interventions pertaining to: community and applied arts practices, pedagogy, critical journalism, the composition and performance of music and sound, theatre and performance, contemporary visual and media-arts practice, and administrative, artistic and curatorial leadership of cultural organizations.

Theme 4: Media, institutions and the politics of participation
	• The political economy of media and communication
	• The role of technology in knowledge formation, agency, and critiques of capitalism
	Our investigation into media power at a variety of sites and scales seeks to uncover the relationships between institutions, technology, and media practices. We apply a political economy lens to the policies of organizations and industries in national media cultures and comparative contexts. We trace patterns of political engagement, social disruption, and fragmentation within media cultures. Our examination of digitization—across interfaces, infrastructures, and cultural objects—contributes to the critical study of new knowledge environments) and new visual cultures alongside investigations of commoditization, control and surveillance within digital spaces.

Alan Stanbridge is an Associate Professor in Visual and Performing Arts (Arts Management/Music and Culture) in the Department of Humanities at the University of Toronto at Scarborough, and he is cross-appointed in the Museum Studies Program in the iSchool (Faculty of Information) and in the Graduate Department of the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto. He has taught undergraduate courses in Cultural Theory, Cultural Policy, Collaborations, and Jazz History, graduate Museum Studies courses in Cultural Policy and Contemporary Theories of Art and Culture, and graduate Music courses in Music and Discourse and Music Research. Stanbridge is the recipient of a Faculty Teaching Award for his contribution to undergraduate teaching.
Stanbridge has published articles on popular music, jazz history, cultural policy, and cultural theory, and he is currently working on a book entitled Rhythm Changes: Jazz, Culture, Discourse, to be published by Routledge. He is a contributor to the Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, writing the main entries on Jazz (for Volume VIII) and on Postmodernism (for Volume I), with the main entry on the Hollywood Musical forthcoming in Volume XII. He is a member of the Editorial Boards of the International Journal of Cultural Policy and the Jazz Research Journal, and a member of the Advisory Board of Critical Studies in Improvisation/Études critiques en improvisation. Stanbridge also serves as a Research Collaborator on the international research project on Improvisation, Community, and Social Practice, which is supported by a Major Collaborative Research Initiatives (MCRI) grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). Stanbridge has presented papers at conferences in Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, Germany, Austria, Scotland, England, the United States, and Canada, and he has been a regular cultural commentator on CBC Radio.
Stanbridge's current interdisciplinary research project focuses on the manner in which a variety of discourses have shaped contemporary understandings of musical meaning and cultural value. These discourses have tended to become codified and naturalised, and have had a profound influence on the production, circulation, regulation, and reception of various forms of music. Drawing on a diverse range of musical examples from the early 20th Century to the present day, Stanbridge's research explores the shifting value judgements that have served to circumscribe cultural artefacts, tracing the historical origins and contemporary trajectories of these evaluative discourses. His research project has been supported by a grant from SSHRC.
In a previous life, Stanbridge pursued a 15-year career in professional arts management and music promotion in Britain, during which time he held the post of Director of the Glasgow International Jazz Festival, and occupied senior management positions with several arts centres and music organizations, including Midlands Arts Centre (mac), the Almeida Theatre, and Jazz Services. Throughout his career, Stanbridge has been responsible for the programming and coordination of a diverse range of arts events, and he has promoted numerous concerts and specially commissioned projects featuring Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Stan Getz, Lee Konitz, Gerry Mulligan, Oscar Peterson, Astor Piazzolla, John McLaughlin, Willem Breuker, John Surman, Derek Bailey, John Stevens, the Brotherhood of Breath, Fred Frith, John Zorn, Tim Berne, Philip Glass, and John Cage, among many others.

safeTALK is a 3 hour suicide prevention training that helps participants identify people who are at risk, confidently ask them about the topic of suicide, and connect them with resources that can help them stay safe. 
Goals and Objectives

	Suicide-alert people are better prepared to connect 
	persons with thoughts of suicide with life-affirming help. 
Over the course of their training, safeTALK participants

	• Notice and respond to situations where suicide 
	thoughts may be present 
	• Recognize that invitations for help are often 
	overlooked 
	• Move beyond the common tendency to miss, 
	dismiss, and avoid suicide 
	• Apply the TALK steps: Tell, Ask, Listen, KeepSafe 
	• Know community resources and how to connect 
	someone with thoughts of suicide to them for 
	further suicide-safer help.

About the Flourish program
The university campus is a fertile setting for students to flourish – i.e., to grow intellectually, socially and emotionally and to translate this growth into action, habit and purpose. Flourish is a UTSC program to help you learn skills that foster growth. By systematically identifying academic and character strengths, the program will help you to learn effective stress management, improve your academic performance and boost your overall well-being.
Flourish is a collaborative initiative involving Academic Advising & Career Centre, AccessAbility Services, Athletics & Recreation, Health & Wellness Centre, Office of the Registrar, Office of the Dean (Academic), and the Office of Student Affairs & Services. Our sincere goal is to support your success at UTSC by creating an inclusive learning environment where you:
• are intellectually and socially engaged;
• harness the best within you toward a purpose that you have defined
• feel that you matter!

In picture, UTSC Alumna and WiLi program founder, Gigi Pang (front middle), UTSC Alumna Grace Lau (front left), and Executive Director Georgette Zinaty (front right) with the inaugural cohort of the Women in Leadership Initiative program.
More qualified women are now graduating from universities across Canada than ever before. However women continue to lag behind their male colleagues when it comes to achieving senior leadership positions. The glass ceiling still exists: Women hold a mere 8.5% of the highest-paid positions in Canada’s top 100 listed companies, and female CEOs are more often hired from outside the company than male CEOs are. In fact, in 2015, out of 87 incoming CEOs, only one was a woman. This points to the continued trend of women not being recognized within their own organizations.
McKinsey and Company’s 2016 Women in the Workplace report noted “Women get less access to the people and opportunities that advance careers, and are disadvantaged in many of their daily interactions. These inequities appear to take a toll on women: They are less likely to think they have equal opportunities for growth and development—and more likely to think their gender will play a role in missing out on a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead.”
Studies show that mentoring relationships play a critical role for women seeking advancement. The women in leadership initiative will provide both informal and formal mentoring and in-depth skill development opportunities to mentees chosen through a selective application process. Female University of Toronto Scarborough alumni who are leaders in the arts, business and non-profit sectors will act as mentors to young females with leadership potential from our community.
The goal of the Partners in Leadership alumni mentorship program is to tap into the vast professional experience of U of T Scarborough alumni to help our students transition from student life to work life and assist in strengthening their self image and vision of their possible futures.
With Partners in Leadership we aim to provide experiential learning for our students by infusing our alumni community and resources into student life, in order to enrich the overall student experience.
If you are entering your final year and would like to participate as a mentee, please fill out our application.
If you would like to reconnect with UTSC and make a difference in the life of a current undergraduate, fill out our application to become a Partner in Leadership!

The University of Toronto Scarborough’s Leader2Leader Conference celebrates the influential roles our alumni play in today’s evolving workforce and business landscape.
In previous years it has been a day-long roster of leadership workshops and panel discussions designed to promote dialogue and information-sharing between speakers and panelists who are leaders from various industries, to a diverse audience of soon to be graduates, proud alumni and community members. This year we have changed the scope and structure of the conference based on feed back from our past audience and participants.  Looking for more opportunities to connect and interact with alumni, in addition to our keynote address, the afternoon will consist of an interactive hands-on networking program that will allow as many connections with our audience and alumni in speed networking format.
