In order to make this a successful project, we need to work together to
implement each of the modules properly. First we need to learn the libraries
that is required for this project.

Meeting:

	- We will be meeting at least once per week on Monday Before class in
	person. This will be mandatory for everyone to attend. If one of us is not
	able to make it, others need to keep a note to keep that indivual updated.
	
	- If required, we can have additional that may not be required for everyone
	to attend. For example, if two individuals are working integrating two modules
	then it may not be required to interrupt others who are working on their own parts.
	
Decisions:

	- Decisions will be made through meetings/text chat discussion.
	- If there are disagreements, we will first try a democracy. If theres a tie, flip
	a coin.
	
User Story Priorities:

	- priorities will first start on the functionality of the project. As the backend
	will cater to the corpus once it is completed, the specifics on the responses can
	be modified once main user functions are completed.	Specifics is shown on the 
	user_stories.md file.
