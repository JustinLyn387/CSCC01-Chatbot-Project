In the current market, we have found the following to be examples of existing products
that solve the same (or similar) problems:

1. Cleverbot:
	This is a simple chat bot that appears to have a good interface for the user to
	communicate with the bot. Unfortunately it does not have the capabilities to learn
	or craw more information to improve upon the model for the responses to the user.
	As such, it does not appear be capable to sufficiently answer user questions.

2. TD Clari
	Useful for displaying account information. Not very capable in terms of search
	queries. This is more optimized for TD users. 
	Scope too niche. Not very good at answering questions.

3. Google assistant/Siri
	scope too wide, cannot be specific enough to what the our audience want to search for.
	This is because it is used as a general information retrieval/qol assistance tool.
	
	
In terms of our product, we can also further cater to the users. This is more customizable
and care for the professional financial tech users of the company that is wants this product.
For the admin, it can be highly customizable to display exactly the data that the user might request
and to cut out the fluff.
For the users, the data and the format that we presents the information in has to be concise, professional, and
to-the-point. The users might not want to spend too much time interacting with the bot due to the nature of their
profession. At the same time, the bot has to be user friendly enough to prove that this is a preferable
approach to answer questions (rather than going through a FAQ for example).
